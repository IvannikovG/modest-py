# Simple example: estimation of 3 parameters in 2R1C thermal network

This example shows how to set up a learning session using ``LearnMan`` class.

Simulation results are saved in `modest-py/examples/simple/workdir`.

Notice that the parameters are interdependent and the same model behavior is 
achieved with different sets of estimates (e.g. compare estimates vs. error on 
`scatter.png`).
